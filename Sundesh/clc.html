          Computers and computer literacy today play an increasingly important
          role in our day-to-day lives. Basic computer literacy has become
          imperative for most employers today and rural youth are often deprived
          of this essential knowledge due to a lack of avenues and options.
          Since villages surrounding SIRUC are located 25 to 40 km away from the
          main Ghaziabad town, it was nearly impossible for local youth to
          travel to the city daily to attend computer classes. They sought
          SUNDESHâ€™s intervention and help in setting up a Computer Literacy
          Centre in their neighbourhood. In partnership with Dabur India Ltd.
          and NIIT Foundation, SUNDESH set up the first computer Literacy Centre
          at SIRUC in December 2017 and enrolled 55 students. With positive word
          spreading about this initiative and more students from neighbouring
          villages expressing interest in joining this course, SUNDESH set up
          its second Computer Literacy Centre in Village Dhaulana on December
          31, 2020. Till date, 219 local youth have successfully completed their
          courses under this initiative.
