                        "The greatest gift to life on Earth is trees. The idea that trees
                        behave as carbon sinks by storing carbon dioxide in their roots,
                        woods, and leaves has already been discussed, but I want to
                        emphasise it. This carbon is not as abundant in our climate, which
                        has the potential to destroy it. A tree can generate wind. When
                        the weather is chilly and windy, the trees planted around the edge
                        operate as windbreakers. The roots of the trees protect the soil,
                        while their leaves break the force of the wind and lessen the
                        effect of rain on the ground. As a result, trees deal with soil
                        erosion, capture rainwater, and monitor stormwater flow and
                        sediment accumulation. In the end, I want to say that trees are
                        excellent for people and that they are the natural guardians of
                        people. They feed us, and our lives are sustained."
